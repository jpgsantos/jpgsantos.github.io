# About Me

## Professional Summary

I'm a Computational Neuroscience PhD graduate with extensive experience in developing and validating mathematical models (ODEs) for biological systems. Throughout my 8-year research journey, I've built a strong foundation in scientific software development, algorithm implementation, and computational problem-solving.

I've proven my ability to architect and build robust scientific software (e.g., Subcellular_Workflow in MATLAB), implementing complex algorithms (parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, PLA) from literature. I'm passionate about tackling complex analytical problems, developing new algorithms, creating reusable tools (FAIR principles), integrating software components, and leveraging modern AI tools (LLMs) to enhance workflow efficiency.

## Career Objectives

I'm seeking to transition from academia to industry, particularly in roles involving algorithm development, software creation, system integration, and tackling novel technical challenges. My target industries include:

- Neurotechnology startups
- Scientific Computing Services
- AI/ML research-focused companies

I prefer dynamic, problem-solving roles focused on development, algorithm design, and research implementation over routine tasks. I enjoy presenting complex ideas and thrive in collaborative, technically challenging environments.

## Outside Academia

When I'm not coding or solving complex problems, I enjoy technology, strategy games, films, reading, biking, and hiking. I value exploring unfamiliar territory—whether physically or intellectually—and embrace the challenge of navigating complexity.

I've also demonstrated my ability to quickly learn new technologies by self-teaching Kotlin basics to build an Android app for personal use.
