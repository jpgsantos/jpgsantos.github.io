# Projects

## Subcellular_Workflow
*PhD Project (2016-2025)*

A modular, FAIR-compliant MATLAB framework for ODE biochemical pathway modeling, analysis, and parameterization. The workflow integrates tools for model initialization, simulation (MATLAB, COPASI via SimBiology), parameter estimation, and global sensitivity analysis and Profile Likelihood Analysis.

**Key Achievements:**
- Architected and built a comprehensive scientific software framework following FAIR principles
- Implemented complex algorithms from scientific literature (parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, PLA)
- Engineered interfaces between MATLAB solvers and COPASI
- Developed tools for converting between SBtab format and other standard formats (SBML)
- Applied the workflow to analyze benchmark models in systems biology and neuroscience
- Created comprehensive documentation and managed Git/GitHub collaboration
- Published results in a peer-reviewed article in *Neuroinformatics*

**Technologies:** MATLAB (SimBiology, Optimization, Stats/ML, Global Opt. Toolboxes), Python (data manipulation), COPASI, Git, GitHub, SBML, SBtab, LaTeX
